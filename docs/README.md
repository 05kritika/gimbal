# Gimbal

Gimbal is an overarching set of projects that includes Contour.  Gimbal builds on and expands to look at Load Balancing through more complicated environments.

Contour is concentrating on providing a solution for a single cluster.  Gimbal expands on this goal to solve scenarios that involve multiple clusters, and load balancing to non-Kubernetes resources.  

## Overview Guides

The following guides will describe how components of Gimbal function and interact with other systems:

- [Kubernetes Discoverer](guides/discoverer/kubernetes/README.md)
- [Openstack](docs/discoverer/openstack/README.md)

Guides on how to setup / deploy Gimbal can be found in the [deployment guide](../deployment/README.md).
