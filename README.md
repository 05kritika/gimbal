# ProjectX

Maintainers: [Heptio](https://github.com/heptio)

## Overview

ProjectX is a software defined service discovery and load balancing platform built on Kubernetes and Contour. It provides a scalable, multi-tenant, API-driven ingress tier that routes traffic to multiple endpoints.

This guide will outline how to use Contour, the Kubernetes & Openstack Discoverers, and the Route [CRD (Custom Resource Definition)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/) resource to define ingress routes that send traffic to discovered services. The Contour cluster functions as a Layer-7 software load balancer that can route traffic to multiple backend Kubernetes and Openstack clusters based upon the configuration defined in each Route CRD.

## Prerequisites

ProjectX is tested with Kubernetes clusters running version 1.9 and later.

## Get started

Deployment of ProjectX is outlined in the [deployment section](deployment/README.md).
